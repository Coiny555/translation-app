# translation-app

Welcome to the translation app!

This GUI was [created from this tutorial!](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/real-time-translation-app-using-python/)

I have also went out of the box not from the guide and added a wacky effect! When you catch an exception a funny meme sound will play and a photo will show up.

(To do it, you will have to either tap translate when you have not selected a language, or on the language box, make it empty, I guess you can consider it a secret :) )

I hope you enjoy learning languages!
